Lmod is automatically replacing "gcc/9.3.0" with "intel/19.0.5.281".


Due to MODULEPATH changes, the following have been reloaded:
  1) openmpi/3.1.4     2) zlib/1.2.11

Code Compilation Successful


Sequential Region:	Runhost:bell-a005.rcac.purdue.edu     Time:0.105383


Parallel Region:	Runhost:bell-a005.rcac.purdue.edu     Time:0.016515
Job Completed

Conclusion:
The parallel execution is faster than the sequential execution as the time shows.
